# Open Bases Icons

These fun, beautiful sets of images can be used as placeholders for generated
PDFs and other content used by the openbases! The idea is to provide them in
a separate repository so the primary repos don't need to each serve the files.
The author of most of these icons is Freepick, and each folder
coincides with a particular icon collection on the site. Specific links and 
attributions are contained within. Thank you Freepik for this invaluable
resource to make science a little more fun!
